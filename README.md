# homebrew-cta

A Homebrew tap for the `cta` command - a cute and fluffy cat animation that appears when you mistype `cat`.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap jkinman/cta
brew install cta
```

## Usage

Just type `cta` in your terminal and watch a fluffy cat chase a ball of yarn across your screen!

This is a fun joke command inspired by the classic `sl` (steam locomotive) command that appears when you mistype `ls`.
